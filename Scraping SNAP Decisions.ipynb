    "I used Winny de Jong's super accessible <a href=\"https://datajournalism.com/watch/python-for-journalists\">Python for Journalists</a> course on  datajournalism.com as my introduction to web scraping. From there, I taught myself to iterate across multiple pages.  Finally, I pair coded with a back-end engineer friend to learn other ways of achieving the same goals (storing data in a dictionary instead of a list; iterating through URLs; etc). Thanks, Winny and Nashaad! \n",

    "I decided to practice by scraping the USDA's list of SNAP retailers that have been blacklisted or OKed after complaints. When I started this project, my local corner store had recently started offering more groceries. But the owner told me could not accept SNAP because a former business partner had committed fraud. That's too bad, because great, my neighborhood had lots of EBT users, but not many grocery stores. SNAP blacklist decisions are final; I was curious how often similar situations impacted neighborhoods like mine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Scrape and clean the SNAP decision data **(this notebook)**.\n",
    "2. Compare the data against a map of food deserts and test my hypotheses: \n",
    "    - There are more blacklisted SNAP retailers in food deserts than in more-resourced areas\n",
    "    - If SNAP could be accepted at currently blacklisted locations, some food deserts would noticeably shrink.\n",
    "4. Other directions to explore: \n",
    "    - Which partners have changed ownership since their decisions? \n",
    "    - Is there anything in the full text of the agency decisions worth looking into?\n"

    "New best practices I learned:\n",
    "- Use \"f\" in Python to format logically similar URLs, add them to a variable, and iterate through to avoid adding them manually like I did earlier.\n",
    "- Store row data in a dictionary instead of a list to give each cell an explicit key. This provides more context and gives the flexibility to view data with json instead of pandas, and to use json instead of a csv later. \n",
    "- Use \"print\" within a loop to track what the scraper is doing and throw errors.\n",
    "- Use short, random sleep steps instead of long, consistent ones to throttle without slowing your scraper down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Othr useful things I learned:\n",
    "- \"print(TK.prettify())\" - prints nicely formatted HTML.\n",
    "- You can use .find('a').get('b') together to find an constant and get a related variable.\n",
    "- \"with open\" opens AND closes your csv for you.\n",
    "- In Python, use \"=\" to define a variable or object; \"def\" to define a function.\n",
    "- Like in Excel, it is easy to replace or strip text in a string."
