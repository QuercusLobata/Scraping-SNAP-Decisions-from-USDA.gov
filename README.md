# Scraping-SNAP-Decisions-from-USDA.gov
Used Python and Beautiful Soup to scrape data from a simple table on multiple pages.

I used Winny de Jong's super accessible <a href="https://datajournalism.com/watch/python-for-journalists">Python for Journalists</a> course on  datajournalism.com as my introduction to web scraping. From there, I taught myself to iterate across multiple pages.  Finally, I pair coded with a back-end engineer friend to learn other ways of achieving the same goals (storing data in a dictionary instead of a list; iterating through URLs; etc). Thanks, Winny and Nashaad! 

I decided to practice by scraping the USDA's list of SNAP retailers that have been blacklisted or OKed after complaints. When I started this project, my local corner store had recently started offering more groceries. But the owner told me could not accept SNAP because a former business partner had committed fraud. That's too bad, because great, my neighborhood had lots of EBT users, but not many grocery stores. SNAP blacklist decisions are final; I was curious how often similar situations impacted neighborhoods like mine.
